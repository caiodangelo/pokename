Choose a random Pokémon name to name your project.

This gem choose one from the 151 Pokémons names (Yeah, just the first generation) to be used in your projects.

Thanks http://www.dragonflycave.com/ for your awesome [Pokémon name list generator](http://www.dragonflycave.com/list.aspx)

## Usage

First install the gem:
 
`gem install pokename`

Then just run it:

`pokename`

It will create a new rails project with a name of one of the 150 pokémons.

If you just want to print a pokémon name, without creating a new project. Run:

`pokename -p`

That's all folks! :)
